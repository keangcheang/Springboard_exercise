Capstone topics: 
 1. Machine Learning: High-frequency Trading of Stock Market with Python: I want to analyze stock price in millisecond scale using NASDAQâ€™s limit order book of a company (I haven't decided on which company yet. There are things I want to improve such as data cleaning, visualization and exploration. However, materials that I hope to learn are the application of machine learning like SVM, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, back-testing. This project will take around 4 to 6 weeks. 

2. H-1B Visa Approval Prediction using classficiation model: This idea is to explore and predict whether with certain features will the government certifies the candidates to receive the visa or not. There will be a lot to delve into like what feature important to the classifier to predict a certain outcome. I will be able to apply Machine Learning models like random forest, decision tree and naive bayes. I also wanted to use cross validation and hyperparamters tuning for accuracy improvement. This project will take 4 to 6 weeks. 

3. Predicting House Price Using Machine Learning with Python: I am very interested in real estate especially estate valuation. I want to know how much a price tag of a house to put on. Again I hope to learn machine learning models on how to predict house price. I want to use this knowledge and results from machine learning to benefits audiences like real estate developers. Thing I look forward to learn are linear regression with regularization like lasso. I also can improve my data wrangling and data visualization skills with this project. This projects will include statistical analysis as well as data exploration. In addition, this project will take around 3 to 4 weeks.
