With regard to the capstone project which is about feature selections of important attributes that determine house price in Nashville, there are some data wrangling techniques used to prepare the data and ready for modeling. 

First of all, I have to check the format of each feature regarding their datatypes and their observation sizes. This way I will know if there should be any datatype conversions I should take or any missing values I have to tackle. In this dataset, there are 56,000+ observations with 29 variables and 31 columns.
